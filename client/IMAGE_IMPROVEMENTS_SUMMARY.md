# Image Improvements Summary - Enhanced Doctor Profile Photo Visibility

## ‚úÖ **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### **Problem**: Doctor profile photos were not clearly visible due to:
1. **Heavy gradient overlays** (80% opacity) blocking image details
2. **Insufficient image height** in some components
3. **Lack of proper image optimization** and error handling
4. **Poor image positioning** and object-fit settings

## üîß **Solutions Implemented**

### 1. **Reduced Gradient Overlay Opacity**
- **Before**: `from-black/80 via-black/20 to-transparent` (80% opacity)
- **After**: `from-black/40 via-black/5 to-transparent` (40% opacity)
- **Result**: Much clearer image visibility while maintaining text readability

### 2. **Enhanced Image Dimensions**
- **TeamSection**: Increased from `h-80` to `h-96` (384px)
- **DoctorProfile**: Increased from `h-96` to `h-[500px] lg:h-[600px]`
- **Result**: Larger, more prominent doctor photos

### 3. **Improved Image Positioning**
- **Added**: `object-center` class for better image centering
- **Enhanced**: `object-cover` for optimal image scaling
- **Result**: Better composition and focus on doctor faces

### 4. **Advanced Image Error Handling**
- **Created**: `src/utils/imageUtils.js` with comprehensive image utilities
- **Added**: Fallback images when doctor photos fail to load
- **Implemented**: Consistent error handling across all components

### 5. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Added**: `loading="lazy"` for better page performance
- **Implemented**: Image preloading utilities
- **Added**: Image validation and optimization functions

## üìÅ **Files Modified**
